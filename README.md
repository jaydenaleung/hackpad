# D-MACROPAD
Here's my Hackpad starter project for Hack Club's Highway to Undercity program! I made this to become more familiar with creating a Highway project and to gain more practice before I tackle a custom project.

The D-MACROPAD is a titled, customized macropad with an aesthetic design. With a row of four customizable buttons and the USB-C port hidden in the back, it was made to provide a smooth experience.
